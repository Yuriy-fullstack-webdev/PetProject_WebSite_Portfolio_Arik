# 🚀 [Web Designer & Developer Portfolio]([link site])

This is a personal portfolio project showcasing the skills and projects of a fictional web designer and developer. The main goal was to build a multi-page website from scratch, with a strong focus on **responsive design**, modern **UI/UX principles**, and **interactive elements**.

The project is built using the **Astro.js framework**, which allowed for a fast, performant, and component-based development experience.
